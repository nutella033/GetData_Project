The file acceldata_tidy.txt provides a tidy data set for the Samsung Galaxy S accelerometer data.
The experiments were carried out over 30 subjects and 6 activities. For each subject and activity pair,
our data set provides the mean value and standard deviation of all observations for the subject/activity pair.

The following measurements are included for each subject/activity pair:

1. tBodyAcc (X, Y and Z axes; mean and standard deviation)
2. tGravityAcc (X, Y and Z axes; mean and standard deviation)
3. tBodyAccJerk (X, Y and Z axes; mean and standard deviation)
4. tBodyGyro (X, Y and Z axes; mean and standard deviation)
5. tBodyGyroJerk (X, Y and Z axes; mean and standard deviation)
6. tBodyAccMag (mean and standard deviation)
7. tGravityAccMag (mean and standard deviation)
8. tBodyAccJerkMag (mean and standard deviation)
9. tBodyGyroMag (mean and standard deviation)
10. tBodyGyroJerkMag (mean and standard deviation)
11. fBodyAcc (X, Y and Z axes; mean and standard deviation)
12. fBodyAccJerk (X, Y and Z axes; mean and standard deviation)
13. fBodyGyro (X, Y and Z axes; mean and standard deviation)
14. fBodyAccMag (mean and standard deviation)
15. fBodyAccJerkMag (mean and standard deviation)
16. fBodyGyroMag (mean and standard deviation)
17. fBodyGyroJerkMag (mean and standard deviation)
